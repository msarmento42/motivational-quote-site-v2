            <p>
                Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing tasks. While it’s a common human behavior, chronic procrastination can lead to stress, missed opportunities and lower quality work.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the primary reasons we procrastinate is fear—fear of failure, of judgment or of the task being difficult. Recognizing your fears and addressing them directly can help. Ask yourself what’s holding you back and whether those fears are rational.
            </p>
            <p>
                Breaking tasks into smaller steps makes them less overwhelming. If the first step is easy, you’re more likely to get started. You can use time management techniques like the Pomodoro method to work in short, focused bursts with scheduled breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eliminating distractions is also key. Turn off notifications, use website blockers if needed, and create a dedicated workspace. Setting clear deadlines and creating accountability with a friend or mentor can increase your motivation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, progress is better than perfection. Even a small amount of work moves you forward. By understanding the causes of procrastination and using practical strategies to overcome it, you can become more productive and reduce stress.
