      <h1>Building Healthy Relationships</h1>
      <p>
        Healthy relationships enrich our lives and support our well-being. Building and maintaining them requires
        effective communication, trust, and mutual respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communication is the foundation. Listen actively and express yourself clearly. Address issues openly
        instead of letting resentment build.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust grows through consistent actions. Keep promises, be reliable, and show that you care. Trust also
        means giving loved ones space and respecting boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutual support is essential. Encourage each other’s goals, celebrate successes, and offer help during
        difficult times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, remember that healthy relationships are a two-way street. Invest time and energy in people who
        reciprocate and respect your needs.
      </p>
