            <h1>Building Healthy Relationships</h1>
            <p>
                Healthy relationships enrich our lives and support our well-being. Building and maintaining healthy relationships requires effective communication, trust and mutual respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Communication is the foundation of any relationship. Listen actively and express yourself clearly. Address issues openly instead of letting resentment build.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trust is built through consistent actions. Keep promises, be reliable and show that you care. Trust also means giving your loved ones space and respecting their boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mutual support is another hallmark of healthy relationships. Encourage each other’s goals, celebrate successes and offer help during difficult times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, remember that healthy relationships are a two-way street. Invest time and energy into those who reciprocate and respect your needs.
            </p>
