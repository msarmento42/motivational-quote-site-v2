            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and protect your
                information when you use our website. We respect your privacy and are
                committed to keeping your personal data secure. By using our site, you
                consent to the practices described herein.
            </p>
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                We collect limited information to enhance your experience. This may
                include data that you voluntarily provide (such as your name and email
                when using the contact form) and technical information collected
                automatically by our web server (such as your IP address and browser
                type). We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data.
            </p>
            <h2>Cookies and Advertising</h2>
            <p>
                Like many websites, we use cookies—small text files stored on your
                device—to remember your preferences and deliver a more personalized
                experience. Cookies may be set by our site or by third‑party
                services such as Google AdSense. AdSense uses cookies to deliver
                relevant advertisements and measure performance. Google’s policies
                require that sites using AdSense provide a clear and accessible
                privacy policy explaining cookie use and obtain consent where
                required【789362596741418†L148-L176】.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can manage cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers
                allow you to refuse cookies altogether or to alert you when a cookie is
                being placed. Please note that disabling cookies may affect the
                functionality of our site. For more details on how Google uses data

            <h2>Use of Information</h2>
            <p>
                The information we collect helps us provide and improve our services.
                We may use your data to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Respond to inquiries and feedback you send via the contact form.</li>
                <li>Analyze site traffic and usage patterns to improve content and design.</li>
                <li>Serve relevant advertising through Google AdSense or other partners.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We
                may share aggregated, non‑identifiable information with service
                providers to help us analyze site performance.
            </p>
            <h2>Data Protection</h2>
            <p>
                We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data from
                unauthorized access. However, no method of transmission over the
                Internet is completely secure. By using our site, you acknowledge
                this risk and agree that we cannot guarantee absolute security.
            </p>
            <h2>Third‑Party Links</h2>
            <p>
                Our site may contain links to external websites that are not
                controlled by us. We are not responsible for the content or privacy
                practices of these sites. We encourage you to review the privacy
                policies of any website you visit.

            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect
                changes in our practices or legal obligations. When we make
