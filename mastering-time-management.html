            <p>
                Time management is the practice of organizing and planning your day to work more efficiently. Good time management allows you to accomplish more in less time, reduce stress and make space for meaningful activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start by identifying your most important tasks. These are the tasks that have the greatest impact on your goals. Schedule these during your peak energy periods when you can concentrate best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use tools like to-do lists, calendars or productivity apps to plan your day. The Eisenhower matrix, which categorizes tasks into urgent and important, can help you prioritize effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Avoid multitasking. It may feel productive, but it often reduces efficiency and increases errors. Focus on one task at a time until completion before moving to the next.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, review your progress regularly. Reflecting on how you spend your time helps you identify patterns and adjust your schedule to maximize productivity.
            </p>
