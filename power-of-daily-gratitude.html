            <p>
                Gratitude is the practice of focusing on and appreciating the positive aspects of our lives. It’s easy to take everyday blessings for granted, but intentionally recognizing them has proven benefits for mental and physical health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting a gratitude journal is a simple way to cultivate this habit. Each day, write down three things you’re grateful for. They don’t have to be big events—small pleasures, like a warm cup of coffee or a pleasant conversation, count too. Over time, this practice trains your brain to notice and savor positive moments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gratitude isn’t just about personal reflection—it’s also about expressing appreciation to others. Write a thank-you note to someone who has made a difference in your life, or take a moment to tell a colleague or friend that you value them. These acts strengthen relationships and spread positivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research shows that practicing gratitude increases happiness, reduces stress and improves overall well-being. It can shift your focus away from what’s missing toward what’s present, fostering a mindset of abundance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, gratitude is a choice. By intentionally looking for things to appreciate, you can improve your mood and build a more positive outlook on life.
