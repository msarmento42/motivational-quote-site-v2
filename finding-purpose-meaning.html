      <h1>Finding Purpose and Meaning</h1>
      <p>
        Purpose isn’t discovered all at once; it’s assembled from values, skills, and service
        over time. You refine it by paying attention to what energizes you and where you can help.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Start with values.</strong> List ten things you care about—then circle the top three.
        Use them as a lens when making decisions about time, work, and relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Notice energy and impact.</strong> Track which tasks leave you more engaged and
        which ones consistently help others. Meaning lives where energy and usefulness overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Do the next right thing.</strong> Purpose grows from repeated acts in a direction,
        not a single epiphany. Take small steps that align with your values and review weekly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Serve beyond yourself.</strong> Contribution turns goals into purpose.
        Find one concrete way to make life easier for someone else this week.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over months and years, these choices add up. Meaning is built—brick by brick—through
        what you pay attention to and what you do for others.
