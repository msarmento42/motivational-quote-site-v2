            <h1>Finding Purpose and Meaning in Life</h1>
            <p>
                Finding purpose and meaning in life gives you a sense of direction and helps you make decisions that align with your values. Without a clear sense of purpose, it can feel like you’re drifting aimlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exploring your passions is a good starting point. Think about activities that make you feel alive and energized. These are often clues to what matters most to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to discover meaning is by considering the ways you want to contribute to the world. Do you want to help people, create art, solve problems, or build communities? Purpose often emerges from using your strengths to serve something greater than yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be patient with yourself. Purpose isn’t always found immediately; it often evolves through experiences. Keep exploring, be open to change and trust that your path will become clearer as you learn and grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, purpose comes from living in alignment with your values and making choices that honor what you care about most.
            </p>
