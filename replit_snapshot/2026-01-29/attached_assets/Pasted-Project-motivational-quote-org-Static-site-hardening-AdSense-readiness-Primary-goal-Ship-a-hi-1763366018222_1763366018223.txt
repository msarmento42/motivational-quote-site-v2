Project: motivational-quote.org — Static site hardening & AdSense readiness

Primary goal: Ship a high-quality, static site that meets AdSense policies and Search best practices, with Auto Ads only, strictly public-domain quotes with proper author attribution, and deployment via GitHub → Netlify.

Inputs (fill any blanks before starting)

DOMAIN: motivational-quote.org

ADSENSE_PUB_ID: pub-6175161566333696 (Auto Ads only)

GITHUB_REPO: (use existing repo for this site; if none, create) motivational-quote-org

GITHUB_USER: <your GitHub username>

GITHUB_PAT (repo write): <paste secret>

NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: <paste secret>

NETLIFY_SITE_ID: <paste site id>

ORG_NAME: Motivational Quotes

ORG_LOGO_URL: https://motivational-quote.org/favicon-512.png (we’ll generate)

CONTACT_EMAIL: contact@motivational-quote.org

PRIVACY_EMAIL: privacy@motivational-quote.org

Constraints

AdSense: implement Auto Ads only (no manual ad units). Include the script on content pages; keep it off /privacy.html, /terms.html, /contact.html, /editorial-policy.html, /attribution.html if desired (not required for Auto Ads, but we’ll prepare a toggle). 
Google for Developers

Quotes: strict public-domain only (US). Prefer authors whose works were published ≤1929 (now PD in the US) and clearly attribute each quote. Store in a local JSON file; do not call external quote APIs. 
Duke Law School

Content quality: pages must be original, people-first, and substantial (≥1,000 words for long-form posts). Add bylines, last-updated, internal links. 
Google for Developers

Deliverables

Repo setup

Create/normalize a static site repo with this structure:

/public
  /assets (CSS, images, icons)
  /posts (HTML articles)
  /quotes/quotes.json (public-domain quotes w/ author fields)
  index.html, about.html, contact.html, privacy.html, terms.html
  editorial-policy.html, attribution.html, blog.html, 404.html
  robots.txt, sitemap.xml, ads.txt, favicon set (16/32/180/192/512)
  opengraph-home.jpg, opengraph-blog.jpg
  app.js, style.css
netlify.toml
README.md


Initialize git, set remote origin to GITHUB_REPO, push main.

AdSense Auto Ads (site-wide, content pages only)

Insert once in <head> of all content pages:

<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-{{ADSENSE_PUB_ID}}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


(Skip or feature-flag on util pages: privacy/terms/contact/editorial-policy/attribution/404.)

Create a tiny helper include or build step so the script is easy to toggle.

ads.txt

Create /public/ads.txt with exactly:

google.com, {{ADSENSE_PUB_ID}}, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0


Google for Developers

Robots & Sitemap

/public/robots.txt:

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://{{DOMAIN}}/sitemap.xml


Google for Developers

Generate a static /public/sitemap.xml that lists all HTML pages and /posts/*. Re-generate automatically during build if files change. Follow Search Central sitemap XML format. 
Google for Developers

Public-domain quotes with attribution (no external APIs)

Create /public/quotes/quotes.json (100–150 entries) with:

[{ "text": "...", "author": "..." }, ...]


Sources limited to authors firmly in US public domain (e.g., Lao Tzu, Marcus Aurelius (public translations only), Aristotle, Epictetus, Confucius, Emerson, Thoreau, Seneca, Sun Tzu, Lincoln’s public speeches, etc.). Include a comment in README describing PD criteria. Cite Duke Public Domain Day 2025 in README as the rule-of-thumb reference. 
Duke Law School

Update app.js to load from /quotes/quotes.json, randomly display a quote, and render an author line. Remove any ZenQuotes or third-party calls.

Content quality & E-E-A-T

Create or upgrade these pages:

about.html (purpose, who runs the site).

editorial-policy.html (original content, PD-only quotes, fact-checking).

attribution.html (how we attribute quotes; PD policy; contact for corrections).

contact.html (email link + basic form mailto: fallback).

privacy.html, terms.html (retain; ensure clarity).

blog.html (lists all posts; newest first).

Ensure each post has: descriptive H1, table of contents, H2/H3 structure, internal links to 2–4 related posts, byline, and “Updated on” date. Content must be people-first and original (≥1,000 words for the long posts). 
Google for Developers

Meta, canonical, structured data, and social cards

Each page:

<title> ≤ 60 chars; <meta name="description"> 140–160 chars.

Canonical absolutely-addressed to https://{{DOMAIN}}/....

Open Graph + Twitter Card (summary_large_image).

JSON-LD:

WebSite on index.html (with name, url, publisher Organization using ORG_NAME and ORG_LOGO_URL).

BreadcrumbList on posts.

Provide opengraph-home.jpg and opengraph-blog.jpg (1200×630).

Design & performance

One responsive CSS (/public/style.css), semantic HTML, accessible contrast.

Lazy-load images, compress JPG/PNG, preconnect to https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com.

Lighthouse target: Performance ≥ 90 on desktop, ≥ 85 on mobile.

404 page

Friendly 404 with links back to Home and Blog. Return proper status with Netlify config.

Netlify

Add /netlify.toml:

[build]
publish = "public"

[[redirects]]
from = "/*"
to = "/404.html"
status = 404


Install Netlify CLI and set up a deploy script:

If token & site ID provided, run netlify deploy --prod --dir=public --site={{NETLIFY_SITE_ID}}.

Otherwise, output manual steps.

Google for Developers

CI & source control

Commit granularly. Open a PR titled “AdSense readiness + PD quotes + SEO hardening”.

On success, squash-merge to main and tag v1.0.0-adsense-ready.

Validation & handoff

Sanity checks:

ads.txt resolves at https://{{DOMAIN}}/ads.txt.

robots.txt and sitemap.xml valid.

Auto Ads script present on content pages, omitted where flagged.

Random quote renders with correct author, page passes W3C HTML validation.

Provide a brief CHECKLIST.md summarizing what was done and how to re-submit in AdSense (“Sites → motivational-quote.org → Request review”).

Output a zipped artifact of the /public folder and a link to the live Netlify URL.

Definition of Done (acceptance criteria)

Site builds to /public and deploys to Netlify production successfully.

ads.txt present with Google seller ID; Auto Ads script uses {{ADSENSE_PUB_ID}}. 
Google for Developers

Quotes render from local JSON, all entries PD-safe and attributed.

All pages have canonical, OG/Twitter, JSON-LD, and pass a basic HTML validator.

sitemap.xml enumerates all pages and posts and is linked from robots.txt. 
Google for Developers

At least 20 long-form posts meet people-first content guidance with bylines and internal links. 
Google for Developers

404 works and returns status via Netlify.

README documents PD policy, content guidelines, and how to add new posts.

If anything is missing

If tokens aren’t provided, halt before deployment and print what’s needed: GITHUB_PAT, NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN, NETLIFY_SITE_ID.

If a conflicting repo exists, choose the most recently updated one for this domain name or create motivational-quote-org and push there, then wire Netlify to it.

What I still need from you (so the Agent can run end-to-end)

GitHub PAT with repo scope.

Netlify: NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN and Site ID for motivational-quote.org.

Confirm the target repo name (use existing or create motivational-quote-org).

Optional: confirm utility pages where you want to omit the Auto Ads script (I’ll default to omitting on privacy/terms/contact/editorial-policy/attribution/404).

If you give me those three secrets + the repo name, you can paste the brief above into Replit Agent and it will orchestrate the whole thing.
