      <h1>Setting Boundaries for Self-Care</h1>
      <p>
        Boundaries are the rules you set to protect your time, energy, and values.
        Clear limits reduce resentment and make it easier to show up generously.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Define your non-negotiables.</strong> Sleep, exercise, focused work blocks,
        family time—pick a few priorities and schedule them first.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Say no without drama.</strong> Try short, kind scripts:
        “I can’t take this on right now,” or “That won’t fit this week.”
        No extras needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>State limits up front.</strong> Share availability, response times, and meeting windows.
        Expectations prevent friction later.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use environment design.</strong> Turn off nonessential notifications, set do-not-disturb,
        and keep work apps off your home screen outside work hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Review and adjust.</strong> Boundaries change with seasons. Reassess monthly and refine
        anything that isn’t serving you.
