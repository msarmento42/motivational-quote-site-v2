            <p>
                Setting boundaries is essential for maintaining your physical, emotional and mental well-being. Boundaries help define what you’re comfortable with and what you need to protect your energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start by identifying your values and needs. Are there times when you feel overwhelmed or taken advantage of? Recognize situations that cause you stress and think about what limits could prevent that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Communicating boundaries clearly and respectfully is key. You don’t need to apologize for setting limits. You can simply say, ‘I’m not available for calls after 7 p.m.’ or ‘I need time alone to recharge on weekends.’
            </p>
            <p>
                Enforcing boundaries can be challenging at first, especially if others are used to your flexibility. Expect resistance, but stay firm. With consistency, people will respect your limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, setting boundaries isn’t selfish—it’s a form of self-care. It allows you to conserve energy, maintain healthy relationships and focus on what matters most to you.
            </p>
