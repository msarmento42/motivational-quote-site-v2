      <h1>Developing Empathy and Compassion</h1>
      <p>
        Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It forms the foundation of strong
        relationships and helps create compassionate communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cultivate empathy, listen actively. Instead of waiting for your turn to speak, focus on what the other
        person is saying. Ask open-ended questions and reflect their feelings back to them to show you’re engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practice perspective-taking. Put yourself in someone else’s shoes and imagine how they might experience a
        situation differently. This reduces judgment and fosters understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy isn’t about fixing someone else’s problems; it’s about being present and validating their feelings.
        Often, simply knowing that someone cares and understands can be deeply healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, be kind to yourself. Self-compassion increases empathy for others. When you treat yourself with
        empathy, you build the capacity to extend the same kindness to those around you.
      </p>
