      <h1>Cultivating Resilience in Adversity</h1>
      <p>
        Resilience is the capacity to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity. It helps us recover from setbacks,
        learn from failure, and keep moving forward when things get tough. Developing resilience isn’t about
        avoiding challenges—it’s about building the mental and emotional tools to navigate life’s ups and downs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start with mindset. When you encounter obstacles, frame them as opportunities for growth rather than
        insurmountable problems. This shift helps you take constructive action. Keep a clear sense of purpose—
        knowing your “why” makes it easier to persevere when times are hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social support matters. Surround yourself with friends, family, and mentors who encourage you and believe
        in your potential. Being able to talk openly about struggles and receive genuine support makes a tremendous
        difference when you’re overwhelmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practice self-care. Physical activity, adequate rest, and nourishing food give you the energy to cope
        with stress. Mindfulness—such as meditation and deep breathing—can keep you grounded when emotions run high.
        Resilience isn’t about being invincible—it’s about learning to bounce back stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, resilience grows through mindset, support, and self-care. Work these muscles consistently and
        you’ll become more flexible and resourceful in the face of challenges.
