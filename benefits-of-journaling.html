      <h1>The Benefits of Journaling for Self-Discovery</h1>
      <p>
        Journaling is the practice of writing down your thoughts, feelings, and experiences.
        It’s a simple yet powerful tool for self-discovery and emotional processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many approaches, from free writing to structured prompts.
        Start with a few sentences each day describing what happened and how you felt.
        Over time, you’ll notice patterns in emotions and behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Journaling clarifies your thoughts and reduces mental clutter. By putting words on paper,
        you gain distance from your thoughts and can see them more objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s also an excellent problem-solving tool. Writing about a challenge helps you explore
        possible solutions and understand your feelings more deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consistency is key. Even a few minutes each day can lead to meaningful insights.
        There’s no “right” way to journal—the most important thing is to make it a regular practice.
      </p>
