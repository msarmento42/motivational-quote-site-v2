            <p>
                Self-talk is the internal dialogue you have with yourself. This inner voice influences your emotions, beliefs and actions. Positive self-talk can boost confidence and motivation, while negative self-talk can undermine your efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step to harnessing self-talk is awareness. Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Do you encourage yourself or are you overly critical? Common negative self-talk patterns include catastrophizing, labeling yourself negatively and assuming the worst.
            </p>
            <p>
                Challenge negative thoughts by questioning their accuracy. Ask yourself, ‘Is this thought true? Does it help me? What evidence do I have to support it?’ Often, negative thoughts are based on assumptions rather than facts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Replace negative thoughts with more realistic, supportive statements. For example, swap ‘I always mess things up’ with ‘Sometimes things go wrong, but I learn and do better next time.’
            </p>
            <p>
                Practicing positive self-talk doesn’t mean ignoring challenges; it means approaching them with compassion and optimism. By shifting your inner dialogue, you’ll build greater resilience and self-belief.
            </p>
