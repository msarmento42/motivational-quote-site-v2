      <h1>Mindfulness for Personal Growth</h1>
      <p>
        Mindfulness is paying attention on purpose—seeing thoughts, feelings, and sensations
        as they are, then choosing how to respond. It’s less about emptying the mind and more
        about noticing what’s present without judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Start with a one-minute pause.</strong> Sit comfortably. Notice your breath
        as it moves in and out. When attention wanders, bring it back—gently. One minute is enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Label what you notice.</strong> “Thinking,” “worrying,” “planning,” “tension in shoulders.”
        Labels create a small gap between stimulus and response so you can choose your next move.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use everyday cues.</strong> Waiting in line, red lights, kettle boiling—let these
        moments trigger a few mindful breaths. Repetition builds the habit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bring mindfulness to action.</strong> During a difficult email, notice your body,
        soften your jaw, and re-read before sending. Mindfulness turns reactivity into intention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, small practices reduce stress and sharpen attention—making growth feel more doable.
