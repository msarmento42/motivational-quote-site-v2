            <p>
                Letting go is a powerful practice that allows us to move forward and find peace. Holding on to things that no longer serve us—whether they’re beliefs, relationships or memories—can weigh us down and prevent us from growing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step in letting go is acknowledgment. Recognize what you’re holding onto and how it affects you. Accept that it’s okay to release things that are not aligned with your well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, practice forgiveness. This includes forgiving yourself for past mistakes and forgiving others who may have hurt you. Forgiveness isn’t about condoning harmful behavior; it’s about freeing yourself from the grip of anger or resentment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engage in rituals or symbolic acts to help you let go. Writing a letter and then tearing it up, or decluttering your space, can create a tangible sense of release.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, letting go opens up space for new experiences. By releasing what weighs you down, you invite new possibilities and growth into your life.
            </p>
