            <h1>Embracing Change and Uncertainty</h1>
            <p>
                Change is a constant in life, yet it often feels unsettling. Learning to embrace change instead of resisting it can make you more adaptable and resilient.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start by reframing your perspective on change. Rather than seeing it as a threat, view it as an opportunity for growth. Change often forces us to learn new skills, explore unfamiliar territories and step out of our comfort zones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developing a growth mindset can help. When you believe that your abilities can be developed, you’re more likely to see change as a chance to expand rather than as a setback.
            </p>
            <p>
                Practice flexibility by intentionally putting yourself in new situations. This might mean taking on a new project at work, exploring a different hobby, or traveling to a place you’ve never been. As you encounter small changes and adapt, bigger changes become less intimidating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, cultivate a support network. Friends, family and mentors can provide guidance and encouragement when navigating transitions. You don’t have to face change alone.
            </p>
