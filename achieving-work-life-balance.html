            <p>
                Work-life balance is about more than dividing your time evenly between work and personal activities. It’s about feeling satisfied in each area of your life and making adjustments when one area takes over.
            </p>
            <p>
                Set realistic boundaries for yourself. Decide when you will start and finish work each day, and stick to those times. Communicate your boundaries to colleagues or clients so they know when you’re unavailable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prioritize tasks. Determine which tasks are most important and focus on those first. This helps you stay productive during work hours and prevents tasks from spilling over into personal time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Schedule breaks and leisure activities. Treat personal time with the same importance as work commitments. Exercise, hobbies and spending time with loved ones should be part of your routine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember that work-life balance looks different for everyone. Adjust your schedule and priorities to suit your needs. Regularly assess your balance and make changes as needed.
            </p>
