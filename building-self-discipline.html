      <h1>Building Self-Discipline for Long-Term Success</h1>
      <p>
        Self-discipline is the ability to consistently take actions that align with your long-term goals, even when it’s difficult.
        It involves resisting short-term temptations in favor of long-term gains.
      </p>
      <p>
        A practical way to strengthen self-discipline is to build routines. Routines reduce decision fatigue by creating automatic behaviors.
        For instance, if you always exercise in the morning, you don’t have to decide each day when or if you’ll work out—it becomes a habit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Break big goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Completing small tasks gives you a sense of progress and accomplishment, making it easier to stay on track.
        Techniques like Pomodoro (25 minutes focus, 5 minutes rest) can improve focus and discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Track your progress. Journaling or using a habit-tracking app increases accountability.
        Celebrate small wins and recognize improvements—self-discipline grows through consistent effort over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: self-discipline isn’t about being perfect. Everyone slips up occasionally.
        Learn from setbacks, adjust, and keep moving forward with self-compassion.
      </p>
